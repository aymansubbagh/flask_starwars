Kylo tortures Poe using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">the Force</a> and learns of <span class="nowrap">BB-8</span>. Stormtrooper <span class="nowrap"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_(Star_Wars)" title="Finn (Star Wars)">FN-2187</a></span>, disillusioned by the First Order, frees Poe, and they escape in a stolen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_fighter" title="TIE fighter">TIE fighter</a>.

Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo, who Kylo states means nothing to him.
                      </p><p>Aboard the <i>Falcon</i>, Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi" title="Jedi">Jedi Order</a> but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices.

Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_mind_trick" class="mw-redirect" title="Jedi mind trick">Jedi mind trick</a> on a guard.
                      </p><p>At the Resistance base on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Qar" class="mw-redirect" title="D&#39;Qar">D'Qar</a>, BB-8 finds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>, who had been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking the main facility. Using the <i>Falcon</i>, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately refuses and kills his father.

As the Resistance forces flee, Starkiller Base implodes. On D'Qar, Leia, Rey and Chewbacca mourn Han's death. <span class="nowrap">R2-D2</span> awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey uses to find the oceanic planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahch-To" class="mw-redirect" title="Ahch-To">Ahch-To</a> in the <i>Falcon</i>.
                      </p><p>On Ahch-To, Rey finds Luke atop a cliff on a remote island. Without a word, she presents him with his father's lightsaber.
