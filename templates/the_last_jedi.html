                      <p>Shortly after the destruction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starkiller_Base" class="mw-redirect" title="Starkiller Base">Starkiller Base</a>, General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leia_Organa" class="mw-redirect" title="Leia Organa">Leia Organa</a> leads the evacuation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_(Star_Wars)" title="Resistance (Star Wars)">Resistance</a> forces when a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Order_(Star_Wars)" title="First Order (Star Wars)">First Order</a> fleet arrives. Against Leia's orders, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe_Dameron" title="Poe Dameron">Poe Dameron</a> leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought. The remaining Resistance escapes into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)" class="mw-redirect" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperspace</a>, but the First Order uses a device to track them, and attacks again. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylo_Ren" title="Kylo Ren">Kylo Ren</a> hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother Leia's presence on board, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is dragged into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space" title="Outer space">space</a>, but survives by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">the Force</a>. While Leia recovers, Vice Admiral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amilyn_Holdo" title="Amilyn Holdo">Holdo</a> assumes command of the Resistance. Running low on fuel, the remaining fleet is pursued by the First Order.
                      </p><p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahch-To" class="mw-redirect" title="Ahch-To">Ahch-To</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_(Star_Wars)" title="Rey (Star Wars)">Rey</a> attempts to recruit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> to the Resistance. Under self-imposed exile, Luke refuses to help and says that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> should end. After encouragement from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>, he agrees to give Rey three lessons in the ways of the Force. Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, which puzzles them both. Kylo tells Rey that Luke feared his power; Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" title="Supreme Leader Snoke">Snoke</a> was corrupting him, which prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library, but hesitates. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_ghost" class="mw-redirect" title="Force ghost">spirit</a> of Luke's master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda" title="Yoda">Yoda</a> appears and destroys the library by summoning a bolt of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning" title="Lightning">lightning</a>. He encourages Luke to learn from his failure.
                      </p><p>Meanwhile, Poe entrusts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_(Star_Wars)" title="Finn (Star Wars)">Finn</a>, mechanic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Tico" title="Rose Tico">Rose</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB-8" title="BB-8">BB-8</a> with a secret mission to deactivate the First Order's tracking device. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maz_Kanata" title="Maz Kanata">Maz Kanata</a> directs them to the casino town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canto_Bight" class="mw-redirect" title="Canto Bight">Canto Bight</a>, where they meet the hacker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_(Star_Wars)" class="mw-redirect" title="DJ (Star Wars)">DJ</a>. Pursued by the local security, they escape the city with the help of stablehand children and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_animal" class="mw-redirect" title="Riding animal">racing animals</a> they set free. Finn, Rose, and DJ infiltrate Snoke's flagship, but are captured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Phasma" title="Captain Phasma">Captain Phasma</a>. Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, who reveals that he connected their minds to discover Luke's whereabouts.
                      </p><p>Holdo plans to evacuate the remaining members of the Resistance using small transport vessels. Believing her plan to be cowardly and futile, Poe leads a mutiny. Leia recovers and stuns Poe with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_(Star_Wars)" title="Blaster (Star Wars)">blaster</a>, allowing the evacuation to proceed. Holdo remains aboard the ship as a decoy to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crait" class="mw-redirect" title="Crait">Crait</a>. DJ buys his freedom by revealing the Resistance's plan to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hux" title="General Hux">General Hux</a>, and the First Order fleet begins firing on the evacuation transports, destroying many.
                      </p><p>Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats his Praetorian Guard with her help. Rey hopes that Kylo has abandoned the dark side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she battles him for control of Lukeâ€™s lightsaber, bisecting the weapon. Holdo sacrifices herself by slicing through Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling the First Order fleet. Rey escapes the destruction while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose; they defeat Phasma and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with obsolete speeders. Rey and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> draw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_fighter" title="TIE fighter">TIE fighters</a> away in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, while Rose stops Finn from sacrificing himself. The First Order penetrates the Resistance fortress using a siege cannon.
                      </p><p>Luke appears and confronts the First Order, allowing the surviving Resistance to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, but they fail to harm him. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes that Luke is not physically present, but projecting his image through the Force. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the <i>Falcon</i>. An exhausted Luke dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells Rey that the Resistance can rise again.
                      </p><p>At Canto Bight, the stablehands recount the story of Luke Skywalker; afterward, one of them moves a broom with the Force and gazes into space.
