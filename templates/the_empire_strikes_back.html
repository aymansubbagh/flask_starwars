                      <p>Three years after the destruction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Star" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Alliance" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a>, led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia" title="Princess Leia">Princess Leia</a>, has set up a new base on the ice planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoth" title="Hoth">Hoth</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" title="Galactic Empire (Star Wars)">Imperial</a> fleet, led by a merciless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, hunts for the new Rebel base by dispatching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)" title="Droid (Star Wars)">probe droids</a> across the galaxy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> is captured by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wampa" class="mw-redirect" title="Wampa">wampa</a> while investigating one such probe, but manages to escape from its lair using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">the Force</a> and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber" title="Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>. Before Luke succumbs to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_spirit" class="mw-redirect" title="Force spirit">Force spirit</a> of his deceased mentor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi" title="Obi-Wan Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, instructs him to go to the swamp planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagobah" title="Dagobah">Dagobah</a> to train under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Master" class="mw-redirect" title="Jedi Master">Jedi Master</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda" title="Yoda">Yoda</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a> discovers Luke and manages to keep him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauntaun" class="mw-redirect" title="Tauntaun">Tauntaun</a> mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning.
                      </p><p>The probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebels' location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-AT_walker" class="mw-redirect" title="AT-AT walker">AT-AT walkers</a> to capture the base, which forces the Rebels to evacuate. Han and Leia escape with <span class="nowrap"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-3PO" title="C-3PO">C-3PO</a></span> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> on the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, but the ship's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)" class="mw-redirect" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperdrive</a> malfunctions. They hide in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt" title="Asteroid belt">asteroid field</a>, where Han and Leia grow closer amidst the tensions. Several bounty hunters, summoned by Vader, assist in searching for the <i>Falcon</i>. Meanwhile, Luke travels with <span class="nowrap"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a></span> in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-wing_fighter" title="X-wing fighter">X-wing fighter</a> to Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; who reluctantly accepts Luke as his apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit. Luke learns more about the Force from Yoda, who lifts his X-wing out of the swamp using the Force.
                      </p><p>After evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bespin" class="mw-redirect" title="Bespin">Bespin</a>, which is governed by Han's old friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Calrissian" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a>. Bounty hunter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_Fett" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a> tracks the <i>Falcon</i> and, with Vader, forces Lando to hand the group over to the Empire. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure Luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force" class="mw-redirect" title="Dark side of the Force">dark side of the Force</a>. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against the wishes of Yoda and Obi-Wan, abandons his training to rescue them.
                      </p><p>Vader intends to hold Luke in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a> by imprisoning him in carbonite, selecting Han to be frozen as an experiment. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt" title="Jabba the Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a>. Lando, still loyal to Han, frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo. Under attack from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)" title="Stormtrooper (Star Wars)">stormtroopers</a>, they fight their way back to the <i>Falcon</i> and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central air shaft. Vader severs Luke's right hand, disarming him, and tempts him to embrace his anger and join the dark side. Luke accuses Vader of murdering his father, but Vader reveals that <i>he</i> is Luke's father. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, where he hangs from an antenna. He reaches out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepathically</a> to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewie to turn back. After Luke is brought aboard, they are chased by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIE_fighter" title="TIE fighter">TIE fighters</a> towards Vader on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Destroyer" title="Star Destroyer">Star Destroyer</a> and find that the <i>Falcon</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">&#39;</span>s hyperdrive has been tampered with, but <span class="nowrap">R2-D2</span> reactivates it, allowing them to escape.

Lando and Chewbacca begin their quest to save Han, as the other rebels watch the <i>Falcon</i> depart.
